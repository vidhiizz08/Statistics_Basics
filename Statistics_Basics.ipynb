        "\n",
        "- Qualitative Data: Descriptive data (e.g., color, gender).\n",
        " -  Nominal Scale: Categories without a meaningful order (e.g., gender, colors).\n",
        " - Ordinal Scale: Categories with a meaningful order (e.g., rankings, education levels).\n",
        "- Quantitative Data: Numerical data (e.g., height, age).\n",
        " - Interval Scale: Equal intervals but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).\n",
        " - Ratio Scale: Equal intervals with a true zero (e.g., weight, height).\n",

        "Discuss the mean, median, and mode with examples and situations where each is appropriate.\n",
        "- Mean: Average value; used for symmetric distributions. Example: Average income.\n",
        "- Median: Middle value; used for skewed distributions. Example: Median house price.\n",

        "  - Positive Skew: Tail on the right; mean > median.\n",
